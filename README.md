# SocialStats
A tool to help with social network statistic tracking!

This program can be used to grab social media statistics from many networks such as:

* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)
* [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/)
* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)

Since SocialStats is written in Python, it's cross-platform.

Currently, we're working on publicly available stats with an option to sign in in the roadmap. Feel free to add suggestions!
Also, a GUI is in the works, hopefully written in Qt.
